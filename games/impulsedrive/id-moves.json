            "notes": "Lean on Me serves two purposes. It’s both for the moments when one Crew Member is helping another with a task or action, or moments of comfort or succor from one Crew Member to another. When you use Lean on Me to assist a Crew Member, you describe an action that supports them or gives them an opportunity. Your description usually comes after their player declares what they are doing, but always before the player rolls. Generally, Lean on Me actions take the form of working alongside them, physically or emotionally propping them up in a significant way when they would struggle alone, or offering advice on their action. When you use Lean on Me to offer someone comfort in an intimate moment, this is an opportunity to show closeness between the characters, whether that intimacy is physical or emotional, camaraderie, friendship, or romantic in nature. These moments often involve vulnerability, either exposed and comforted or vulnerabilities shared. The most literal and emotionally ‘safe’ version of this may be treating injuries or helping an injured or defeated ally to their feet. More abstractly or intimate forms are sharing pains of the past or present. You primary goal when rolling Lean on Me to assist someone is to give them Advantage on their next roll, which is why you roll before they do. You will probably choose to help them, but you don’t have to. Fictionally, this is the most straightforward result to describe when assisting, you have established most of it before your roll. If you choose to bring some relief, describe how your efforts take some of the load off them. Do you say or do something explicitly supportive, or is it merely your taking up part of their load that helps relieve stress? Getting pushed to your limits or being exposed to danger is up to interpretation for the GM and possibly the group at large. The most common interpretation of being pushed to your limits is taking a Stress. To interpret danger, just look at the situation your characters are in, and have a present danger get up in their faces. If they’re not necessarily in direct danger right now, move something in the background. This discussion may even happen before you roll, to help the table understand the stakes of the table. Complication can mean a tough choice, or the relationship between your two characters becomes more complicated or messy. If you don’t choose to avoid getting pushed to your limits or being exposed to danger, it doesn’t necessarily mean one (or both) of these will definitely happen, especially if they just don’t make sense in the situation.

            "note":"To Scope It Out, you must take time and closely study your target. This can often mean interacting with it, or watching someone else do the same. It may take a few minutes, or it may take hours depending on what you are trying to learn and how you are observing.\n\nScoping out a situation isn’t just about learning details, but getting the bigger picture. The SM always describes a situation honestly, such as saying the merc leader carries a large riot shield and directs her troops from the rear. Scoping her out would reveal why she does that - she’s protecting a small child from the battle, and cannot engage aggressively.\n\nNo question in scope it out is asked in a vacuum. Interpret the questions through the circumstances in which they are asked. “Who’s really in control here?” has very different stakes and context when you ask during a firefight, during a tense exchange of prisoners, or during a steamy moment of romance. Preface your question both with how you are interacting with your subject, and the context of what you want the answer.\n\n“I look into their eyes as I caress their cheek, and my voice is barely a whisper. “Would you do it? Would you kill him? For me?” I want to see if they hesitate, of if they are committed. If it comes down to Zeira choosing between Gax’s life and my love, who’s really in control here?”\n\nJust like in Share Expertise, the answers you get are always honest ones, even if the SM has to figure them out on the spot. Once they answer, it’s set in stone. Scope It Out is great for seeing through subterfuge and lies, or figuring out another’s motives.\n\nUnless a Move says otherwise players can only ask questions from the list. If a player asks a question not on the list the SM can tell them to try again or answer a question from the list that seems equivalent.\n\nOf course, some questions might have a negative answer, that’s fine. If there really, honestly is nothing that will give them an edge here, the SM should answer that question with “Nothing, sorry.”"
