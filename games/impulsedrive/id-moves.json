            "notes": "Alpha Strike is most often used when the attacking character is out of immediate danger, but vulnerable to a change in situation once they act violently. Most often, this Move is used for a character sniping someone at range or from cover, or striking an unarmed or unaware target, perhaps from a hidden position or while sneaking up on them. The choices On a 7-9 are about whether your situation remains tenable or if you are going to have to adapt to a very different situation."

            "notes": "Lean on Me serves two purposes. It’s both for the moments when one Crew Member is helping another with a task or action, or moments of comfort or succor from one Crew Member to another. When you use Lean on Me to assist a Crew Member, you describe an action that supports them or gives them an opportunity. Your description usually comes after their player declares what they are doing, but always before the player rolls. Generally, Lean on Me actions take the form of working alongside them, physically or emotionally propping them up in a significant way when they would struggle alone, or offering advice on their action. When you use Lean on Me to offer someone comfort in an intimate moment, this is an opportunity to show closeness between the characters, whether that intimacy is physical or emotional, camaraderie, friendship, or romantic in nature. These moments often involve vulnerability, either exposed and comforted or vulnerabilities shared. The most literal and emotionally ‘safe’ version of this may be treating injuries or helping an injured or defeated ally to their feet. More abstractly or intimate forms are sharing pains of the past or present. You primary goal when rolling Lean on Me to assist someone is to give them Advantage on their next roll, which is why you roll before they do. You will probably choose to help them, but you don’t have to. Fictionally, this is the most straightforward result to describe when assisting, you have established most of it before your roll. If you choose to bring some relief, describe how your efforts take some of the load off them. Do you say or do something explicitly supportive, or is it merely your taking up part of their load that helps relieve stress? Getting pushed to your limits or being exposed to danger is up to interpretation for the GM and possibly the group at large. The most common interpretation of being pushed to your limits is taking a Stress. To interpret danger, just look at the situation your characters are in, and have a present danger get up in their faces. If they’re not necessarily in direct danger right now, move something in the background. This discussion may even happen before you roll, to help the table understand the stakes of the table. Complication can mean a tough choice, or the relationship between your two characters becomes more complicated or messy. If you don’t choose to avoid getting pushed to your limits or being exposed to danger, it doesn’t necessarily mean one (or both) of these will definitely happen, especially if they just don’t make sense in the situation. But it usually will."
