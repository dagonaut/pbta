<h2> Step 5 - Pick Your Stuff (Thangs and Gear)</h2>
<br />Obviously you need some equipment, and luckily we got some for ya. Stuff breaks down into two categories:
<br />Thangs - Unique items that are a permanent compliment to your character (including people, pets and objects).
<br />Gear - Replaceable items that equip your character but without a special attachment or quality.
<br />It’s Your Thang
<br />Characters can have exceptional features or resources that can transcend their Story or Role. Those items, or “Thangs,” are those little extras that add the cream in the moonpie.
<br />An Automatic Thang
<br />Each character starts with one Thang, which is a permanent part of what makes your character who they are and as such they can never be permanently lost, stolen or destroyed. No matter what happens, somehow your Thang will return.
<br />Example:
<br />Beau’s Thang is a Sweet Ride, his ‘71 Hemi Cuda “Traveller.” After it gets thrown in the river by a robotic gorilla everyone is surprised to see Beau driving it again next week, good as new. When asked about it, his response was simple: “I got really good insurance.”
<br />In addition to your automatic Thang, at any time you are given the option to choose a move during Character Creation or Advancement, you can may choose an item from the Thang list instead.

<br /><br />Choose One:
<br /><strong>Animal Companion:</strong> Whether it’s a well-trained hound dog, a talking parrot or a belligerent ape, you’ve acquired an animal that travels with you. Name and describe your animal companion to the DJ.
<br />When you give your Animal Companion a command in a stressful situation, roll +Smooth.
<br />On a 10+ pick 3: On a 7-9 pick 1:
<br />• Your companion obeys immediately.
<br />• Your companion is not harmed or hindered. • Your companion performs particularly well. • Your companion performs happily.
<br /><strong>Aptitude:</strong> You’re especially practiced, trained, or talented at something that is not reflected in your stats. Pick a skill, profession or area of expertise, when rolling for this skill you are always treated as having the appropriate Attribute at +2.
<br /><strong>Assistant:</strong> A faithful butler, wisecracking secretary or maybe a reluctantly helpful family member assists you. Unlike a sidekick, an assistant doesn’t normally go where you go. Instead, assistants work off-screen to help you accomplish goals in multiple places at once.
<br /><strong>Bidness:</strong> A dive bar, a towing service, or a family restaurant, You’ve set up shop that gives you a permanent location to do business, along with a couple extra bucks in your pocket -you start every game session with at least $40 in the till. This place of “bidness” can either be associated with your Story or Role (e.g. gymnasium for All-Stars), or can be completely removed (e.g. key shop, photo booth, etc.).
<br /><strong>Connections:</strong> Whether on the streets, in the clubs or among the rich and famous you know people, and people know you. When you reach out to an old friend for information, roll +Smooth.
<br />On a 10+, you know just the guy and the DJ will give you some useful info.
<br />On a 7-9, you know a guy but the info will cost ya.
<br /><strong>Credentials:</strong> You are a professional and you have the paperwork to prove it. You can choose to be a licensed Private Investigator, a member of the Press, a bail enforcement agent or something similar. These credentials will often allow you access to people, services, and locations that would normally be off limits.
<br /><strong> Fame:</strong> Something you’ve done has made you famous to some small degree. Fame can be a double-edged sword, you can never predict if it will bring you positive or negative attention.
<br />When you encounter someone for the first time who may have heard of you roll +Soul.
<br />On a 10+ they have heard good things about you and you can roll with Something Extra on your next roll dealing with them.
<br />On 7-9 they have heard of you but nothing specific.
<br /><strong>Lab/Workshop:</strong> You have a workspace dedicated to your profession. This might be a machine shop where you fabricate race cars, a recording studio, or even a crime lab. Describe what your workspace is used for to the DJ.
<br /><strong>Sidekick:</strong> Whether it’s your plucky little sister or the orphan kid you caught picking your pocket, you’ve got a sidekick who follows you around emulating everything you do. Sidekicks can be useful in a fight, but they can also become a target. Name and describe your Sidekick to the DJ.
<br /><strong>Signature Weapon:</strong> You have a weapon or other piece of equipment that has been custom tailored for you. Choose a commonly available weapon or other piece of gear, then add, remove or exchange one trait on that item.
<br /><strong>Skilled Doc/Lawyer/Tech/Mechanic on call:</strong> You’ve got a companion who is always available to patch you or your Gear up. Choose a Medical, Legal, Technological, or Automotive professional who is always available, works for free and never asks questions.
<br /><strong>Special Instrument:</strong> You’ve either found, purchased or built the perfect music instrument for yourself. Work out with the DJ what makes it special.
<br /><strong>Sweet Ride:</strong> You’ve acquired a really great car, truck or bike (or in the case of the Good Old Boy, an additional one). Choose a type of vehicle, describe its make, model and appearance, and you can add, remove or exchange one of its traits (see Vehicles under Gear).
<br /><strong>Wealth:</strong> Through an inheritance, investments or just a lifetime of non-stop hustling you’ve acquired a considerable amount of money. You drive luxury cars, live in a swank pad and eat the finest foods. Most of your wealth is tied up at any one time so you can’t buy just anything but you start every game session with at least $100 in your pocket.
