Ammunition
The Sprawl doesn’t require you to count bullets, but some missions might require different kinds of ammo. Most of these simply add a tag to the weapon they’re loaded into.
» AP rounds penetrate armour more easily – a weapon loaded with AP rounds adds the +AP tag
» Airburst rounds explode in the air near a target either by proximity or as controlled by a targeting suite – a weapon loaded with airburst rounds adds the +area and +messy tags
» Explosive rounds explode on impact with a target – a weapon loaded with explosive rounds adds +1 harm and cannot be silenced
» Flechette rounds are a tightly packed bundle of synthetic plastic shards which tear through flesh, but are easily stopped by armour – a weapon loaded with flechette rounds adds +1 harm, but the target’s armour value is doubled. Weapons with the +flechette tag already include the +1 harm
» Gel rounds are designed to be less lethal – a weapon loaded with gel rounds inflicts s-harm instead of its listed harm value; targets harmed by gel rounds add the original harm value (minus armour) to their roll when making the harm move
