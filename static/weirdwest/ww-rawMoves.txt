OTHER MOVES
HARM When you take harm, roll + Harm suffered.
On a 10+, the Marshall chooses one from the following list: *You're out of the action, unconscious, incapacitated, trapped, or panicked. *It's even worse than it looked.  Take +1 harm. *Choose two from the list below.
On a 7-9, the Marshall chooses one from the following list: *You lose your footing. *You lose your grip on something you're holding. *You lose track of something or someone. *You miss noticing something important. *You are stunned for the briefest of moments.
On a miss, the Marshall can still choose one from the 7-9 list if they want, but have to subtract one from your harm suffered to compensate.
OTHER FOLKS WOUNDS When another player inflicts Harm on you, gain Hx with them equal to the Harm inflicted.  (If this takes you to +4 or above, reset to +1 and mark experience.) When you heal another player's harm, gain Hx with them equal to the number of wound segments healed.  (If this takes you to +4 or above, reset to +1 and mark experience.)
MIRACLES By default, you can't work Miracles.  The Gambler, Junker, and Saint all have moves to work Miracles. When you work a Miracle, roll + Strange. On a hit, choose one: *You reach through the Mystic Wastes, and interact with something or someone connected to it. *You create something from the energy of the Mystic Wastes. *Open a window or portal into the Mystic Wastes. *Protect a person or thing from the Mystic Wastes. *Make something known to the entities living in the Mystic Wastes.
By default, the Miracle persists only as long as you actively sustain it, can only reach shallowly into the nearby Mystic Wastes, and will have mystic side effects. On a 7-9 choose one.  On a 10+, choose two. *The effect will persist for a while without you needing to sustain it. *You can reach deeply into the Mystic Wastes for a larger effect. *You can reach broadly into the Mystic Wasters for a wider effect or reach something farther away. *There's no mystical side effects.
On a miss, the power of the Mystic Wastes is no longer under your control.
INSIGHT By default, you don't have access to Insight.  The Homesteader, Lone Rider, and Saint all have moves that give them Insight.
When you gain Insight, the Marshall will tell you honestly what they think your best course of action is.  Take +1 to all die rolls you make while pursuing that course of action.  If you pursue that course and fail anyway, mark experience.
DYIN' When you hit or go past High Noon and don't receive medical attention, choose one.  You can't choose the same option twice over the life of your character. *Come back with +1 Strange. (Max +3) *Come back with a permanent injury, and -1 to any stat. *Come back as a Revenant. *Die.
DINERO MOVES
BUYIN' STUFF When you need to buy a thing, and the Marshall agrees that the thing is readily available, spend Dinero and get the thing.
If the item is scarce, go to a Town's market and roll + Savvy. On a 10+, no problem, buy the thing. On a 7-9, the Marshall will choose one: *It costs 1 more Dinero than you'd expect. *It's available, but only if you meet with a guy who knows a guy. *You find something similar, but not quite. *I had one, but I just sold it to Big Ralph.  Maybe he'll sell it to you?  (You can use a name other than Big Ralph.) 
GIFT GIVIN' When you give someone a gift worth 1 or more Dinero, you can Palaver with them, and treat it as if you got a 10+ without rolling. 
TRACKIN' DOWN A THING When you make it known you're looking for something, such as information, a person, or an opportunity, roll plus Dinero spent (max +3). On a 10+, it comes to you, no strings attached. On a 7-9, it comes to you, or something pretty close to you. On a miss, it comes to you, strings wicked attached. 
COST OF LIVIN' Whenever there's a stretch of Downtime, spend 1 or 2 barter to maintain your lifestyle.  You do not need to spend this if you have a Town or Homestead.
