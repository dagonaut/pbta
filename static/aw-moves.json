            "description": "When you do something under fire, or dig in to endure fire, roll+cool. \nOn a 10+, you do it. On a 7–9, you flinch, hesitate, or stall: the MC can offer you a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or an ugly choice. On a miss, be prepared for the worst.",
            "notes": "You can read “under fire” to mean any kind of serious pressure at all. Call for this move whenever someone does something requiring unusual discipline, resolve, endurance or care. I often say things like “okay, roll to act under fire, and the fire is just how badly that’s going to hurt,” “…and the fire is, can you really get that close to her without her noticing?” or “…and the fire is, if you fuck it up, they’ll be ON your ass.”\nWhenever a character does something that obviously demands a roll, but you don’t quite see how to deal with it, double check first whether it counts as doing something under fire. Come here first. On a 7–9, when it comes to the worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice, you’ll need to look at the circumstances and find something fun. It should be easy to find something; if there weren’t things to go wrong, nobody’d be rolling dice. It can include suffering harm or making another move. However, remember that a 7–9 is a hit, not a miss; whatever you offer should be fundamentally a success, not fundamentally a failure."

On a 10+, they have to choose 1: \n• Force your hand and suck it up. \n• Cave and do what you want. \nOn a 7–9, they can choose 1 of the above, or 1 of the following: \n• Get the hell out of your way. \n• Barricade themselves securely in. \n• Give you something they think you want, or tell you what you want to hear. \n• Back off calmly, hands where you can see. \nOn a miss, be prepared for the worst.",
            "notes":"Going aggro on someone means threatening or attacking them when it’s not, or not yet, a fight. Use it whenever the character’s definitely the aggressor: when the target isn’t expecting the attack, isn’t prepared to fight back, doesn’t want to fight back, or can’t fight back effectively. \n\nIf the target forces the character’s hand and sucks it up, that means that the character inflicts harm upon the target as established, determined by her weapon and the target’s armor. At this point, the player can’t decide not to inflict harm, it’s gone too far for that. \n\nAt your call as MC, the details of the circumstances can give the character’s weapon ap (armor piercing). Suppose Keeler holds a gun to someone’s forehead and tells them what to do, and they force her hand and suck it up. The gun’s to their unarmored forehead, where their body armor isn’t going to help them, so you should declare the damage ap. \n\nA 7–9 is a hit, but that doesn’t mean the attack itself has to connect. You can treat it as a graze, a glancing blow, a near miss, or whatever. What’s important is the character’s got the target’s attention and has forced them to change course or give ground. \n\nOn a 7–9, the target can still choose to cave, or to force the character’s hand and suck it up. In fact, if none of the 7–9 options make sense in the circumstances, they must choose to cave or to suck it up. \n\nFor the details of taking and inflicting harm, see the harm & healing chapter, page 202."

It means studying them carefully through the whole conversation, noticing changes in their tone, the movements of their eyes and hands, their most fleeting expressions. In play, have the player roll this move only (a) when the interaction is genuinely charged, and (b) when you’re going to play the interaction through. \n\nAgain, you might already know the answers to these questions, you might not. Either way, once you’ve said them you’ve committed to them and they’re true. \n\nAlso again, a character can’t just keep reading and rereading someone. Reread someone only when there’s been some significant change in between. \n\ne player can make the roll at the very beginning of the conversation, or at any point during it. Her hold lasts until she spends it or until the conversation ends, so there’s no rush. It’s fair for her to sit on her hold until just the right opportunity for just the right question. \n\nIf it’s two players’ characters interacting, they can totally read each other at the same time. Both roll, both hold, both ask, both answer, no prob. \n\n“Dude, sorry, no way” is a legit answer to “how could I get your character to __?” \n\nAnd again: unhappy revelations, every chance you get."
