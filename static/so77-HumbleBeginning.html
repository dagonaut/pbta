<h1>It’s All About the Humble Beginnings</h1>
<p>Oh I’ve heard it before, baby. Leaving the small town for the bright lights of the City. Whether you came from the corn elds or upstate, this is a new education you’re about to receive. But you best be careful, poor little greenie.  ere’s no make-up  nals when you’re getting schooled in the street.</p>
<p>You didn’t grow up on the mean streets of the inner city, or lug a machine gun through a southeast Asian jungle, and you don’t know the  rst thing about robots and ray guns. You might have spent your youth on a farm in the country, or a three bedroom ranch house in the suburbs, but that doesn’t mean you don’t know a thing or two. Now you’re in the big city and you’ve got plans.</p>
