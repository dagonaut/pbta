<h1>It’s All About Being An Ex-Con</h1>
<p>Where did it all go to Hell for you, baby? Right place, wrong time? Fell in with a bad crowd? Well now you’re out, and you know you don’t want to go back. But it’s so hard to stay clean in these dirty streets. Keep your eye out for the Man and make your way the best you can.
<p>Whether a career criminal or someone wrongfully accused, Ex-Cons have spent time incarcerated - possibly in a state penitentiary for car theft, a federal lockup for racketeering, or maybe an overseas work camp for tra cking contraband. Surviving in prison means learning a lot of skills and making the right kind of friends. Now that you’re out in the public again, what are you going to do to stay out of trouble?
You Get:
<br /><strong>Friends on the Inside:</strong> When you contact your former inmates for information about a crime or a possible criminal introduction, roll +Smooth.<br />
On a 10+, the DJ will tell you something useful about the crime or make the connection.<br />
On a 7-9, the DJ will tell you something that may or may not be useful about the crime, or may require a favor of their own.<br />
...and Choose 1:
<br /><strong>Jailhouse Juryrig:</strong> Being on the inside makes you learn to make do and repurpose things to get the job done. When you scrounge around looking for a specific item such as a tool or part roll +Brains.<br />
On a 10+ it’s not exactly what you needed but it’s close enough.<br />
On a 7-9 it can get the job done, but it’ll only work once or for a short time.<br />
<br /><strong>Jailhouse Tattoos:</strong> When Getting in Someone’s Face, you can roll +Heat instead of +Might.
<br /><strong>Dirty Fighting:</strong> When you attack someone with a melee weapon, the weapon gains +armor piercing.
<br /><strong>Hold Out:</strong> You can conceal objects on your person, whether it’s your drug stash, a weapon or a roll of cash. When you’re searched, roll +Brains.
On a 10+ you may conceal up to three items with the concealed trait or one item without it.<br />
On a 7-9 you may conceal up to two items with the concealed trait.<br />
On a 6- you may conceal one item with the concealed trait.<br />

<br /><strong>Beautiful Disaster:</strong> The worse you look, the hotter you seem. For every harm you take, you gain +1 Smooth. When the damage is healed, the additional Smooth is lost.
<br /><strong>Discreet About Heat:</strong> You know how not to get caught (most of the time). When a move would normally cause you to gain Heat, Roll +Smooth.
On a 10+, you receive no Heat.<br />
On a 7-9, you receive one less Heat or no heat if you’re willing to pay the DJ’s price.<br />
<br /><strong>Repeat Offender (Requires Friends on the Inside):</strong> Increase one Attribute from +1 to +2.
<br /><strong>Career Criminal (Requires Friends on the Inside):</strong> Increase one Attribute from +2 to +3.
