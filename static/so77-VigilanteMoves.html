<h1> Introducing the Vigilante</h1>
Only three types of people shoot folks on a regular basis, sugar. Cops, murderous psychos and vigilantes, You don’t work for  e Man, and you ain’t no murder- ous psycho so that must make you a vigilante. Oh I understand, somebody’s gotta take out the garbage. But you know what they say about those who  ght dragons, baby... sometimes you become one.
<br />Whether it’s from stress, frustration or maybe just for weird kicks, the big city occasionally makes people snap and start doling out their own version of street justice, regardless of whether or not they have the legal right to do so. Although they occasionally “clean the streets” through violent beat- downs, it’s more common to see a Vigilante brandishing a nasty gun, then disappearing into the night after their actions.
<br />Example:
<br />When she’s cool, she’s hot. She’s the bad-ass Black Cherry Stone, Queen of the Dead-End Streets. Since her CIA boyfriend was mowed down by street thugs, nothing is stopping Cherry from getting a little payback. With her twin Peacemakers and thigh-high boots, Black Cherry is cleaning up this town one bullet at a time.

It’s All in the Re exes: When you use a gun to solve a problem or over come an obstacle, roll with Something Extra.<br />
...And Choose 2:<br />
<br /><strong>Out for Blood:</strong> When a Vigilante is in combat, they’re not messing around. When you single out a target for elimination and shoot them you do +1 harm.
<br /><strong>Feelin’ Lucky Punk?:</strong> When you successfully Get In Someone’s Face, you’ve managed to scare the hell out of them for good. Roll with Something Extra against them permanently.
<br /><strong>Eagle Eye:</strong> When you take time to study and observe your target, Roll +Brains.<br />
On a 10+ you identify a weakness and deal +1 harm against that target for the rest of the Scene.<br />
On a 7-9, you spot a weakness but will need to expose yourself or someone else to danger in order to exploit it.<br />
<br /><strong>Both Guns Blazing:</strong> When wielding a gun in each hand, your attack gains +area.
<br /><strong>Wake-Up Call:</strong> When you  re a warning shot to get your target’s attention, Roll +Hustle.<br />
On a 10+ they stop what they’re doing ( eeing,  ghting etc) and are shaken, roll with Something Extra on your next move.<br />
On a 7-9 they merely stop what they’re doing.<br />

<h3>Attributes:</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve chosen to be a Vigilante, it’s time to select your Attributes. At- tributes describe the core of your character in Spirit of 77. Is your Vigilante start- ing the morning with a hundred push-ups? Or maybe burning the midnight oil to plan their attack? Your choice of Attributes will determine how you’re locked and loaded.</p>
<p>Choose one of the following arrays of Attributes and distribute them between Might, Hustle, Smooth, Brains and Soul however you want. Keep in mind the moves you’ve already selected and their associated Attributes and don’t forget, although you can raise an Attribute from 0 to +1 later, you cannot raise an Attribute from -1 to 0 through XP.</p>
<p>Ready for Anything: Take one point for every Attribute, and take the safety o .  is is good for getting your Attributes together quickly and out on the street in
no time.</p>
<div>1, 1, 1, 1, 1</div>
<p>When All Else Fails: Pick one Attribute as your specialty, and add +2. Choose two secondary Attributes and add +1.  is is good when you know you’ll be focusing on a speci c skill in game (like  ghting or thinking things out), but still want to maintain backup skills in case the plan goes south.</p>
<div>2, 1, 1, 0, 0</div>
<p>Don’t Hit Me  ere: Pick one Attribute as your specialty and add +2. Choose one Attribute you’re not so good at and give it -1. Give the other Attributes +1, and wear your sidearm at all times.</p>
<div>2, 1, 1, 1, -1</div>
<p>True Force: Pick the two Attributes you’re planning to use the most and add +2. Choose one Attribute you’re not so good at and give it -1. Leave the rest at zero,
