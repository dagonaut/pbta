<h1>It’s All About the Glam</h1>
<p>Pretty is as pretty does? Yeah, only ugly people say that. Takes a special kind of something-something to always be the shining star in a dark kind of night. They don’t hate you because you’re beautiful, but you’re beautiful ‘cause they hate you. Eat your heart out, small-timers.
<p>Glam is more than just face paint and a sequined out t with an outra- geous attitude, it’s an enigmatic force that surrounds us, binds us together and makes the world a funky place. Or maybe it’s just a lot of smoke and mirrors, glitzy clothes and greasepaint. No matter its source, the power
of Glam has spread throughout the world and taken on a life of its own. You’ve got a touch of the Glam, what will you do with it?
<br />You Get:
<br /><strong>Who Looks Fabulous?: By adopting a Glam lifestyle, your character has an outward appearance more extravagant than others. While you are wearing your Glamorous Wardrobe, anytime you are called upon to roll +Smooth you can roll +Soul instead.
...and Choose 1:
<br /><strong>Sparkle Motion: By spinning around in a circle, you have the capability of changing your clothing from your normal fabulous threads to a more conservative appearance, complete with eyeglasses. In this new appearance, you are unrecognizable compared to your former self until you change back.
<br /><strong>Toast of the Town: When you announce your presence in the beginning of a Scene, roll +Smooth.<br />
On a 10+, everyone in the Scene stops what they’re doing to pay atten- tion to your big entrance.<br />
On a 7-9, you can pick one person who stops and pays attention.
<br /><strong>Mind Reader: The powers of Glam give you an insight into people you talk to. You may roll +Soul instead of +Brains when Giving Someone the  ird Degree.

<br /><strong>That Ain’t Right: The Glam has given you an unsettling presence to be around. When you make a show of freaking people out to intimidate them, roll+Soul.<br />
On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1.<br />
Spend 1 hold to roll with Something Extra on social moves during this Scene.
<br /><strong>Super y: Fire, explosions, machine-gun  re, it doesn’t matter - you always keep your cool. No matter what happens, you, your hair and your clothes always look perfect.
<br /><strong>Dazzling Comeback: When you’ve been disabled, restrained, knocked unconscious or otherwise taken out of the  ght, raise your hand, point to the sky call upon the power of glam and roll+Soul.
On 10+, you recover enough harm to keep  ghting, stand up, or break your bonds and roll with Something Extra for the rest of the combat. On a 7-9, you recover enough harm to keep fighting, stand up or break your bonds.<br />
