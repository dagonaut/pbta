<h1>It’s All About Being A Former Badge</h1>
<p>They say there’s a choice every cop needs to make after he’s been on the street long enough to see the way things work out here - upholding what’s right and upholding the law. But we all know that its hard to do both, don’t we? Ain’t no crime to walk away, as long as you know where you’re going.
<p>City police, county sheriffs, federal agents and even parole officers, you once worked for the Man. You’ve been trained to uphold the law, but now that you’re out of the force how will you apply those skills?<br />

<br /><strong>Friends on the Force: Former cops still have contacts in the local law enforce-

<br /><strong>Packing Heat: Former Badges have practical experience on the firing range with their weapons, which provide a range bonus to pistols - When firing a pistol you may extend the range from close to far.
<br /><strong>The Frisk: Former Badges still know how to check for weapons or other items hidden on a person, even if they no longer have the right to search them. When you search for something hidden, roll with Something Extra.
<br /><strong>Last Boy Scout: When you act to protect a civilian that cannot protect them- selves, roll with Something Extra.
