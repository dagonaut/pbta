 Introducing the Good Old Boy/Girl
<br />I know the story, baby - hot grease and gasoline run in your veins, and your heart is a fully blown supercharged V-8. Your daddy taught you to drive before you learned to read, and you’ve been running  at out ever since. Racing, smuggling or bootlegging, if it involves going fast and evading the law there is nobody better for the job than a Good Old Boy like you.
<br />They may not be the smoothest members of your group, and they may be fresh o  the turnip truck in the big city, but when you need someone that’s willing to drive 120 mph the wrong way down the New Jersey turnpike, you need a Good Old Boy in the driver’s seat.
<br />Example:
<br />Aw shucks, you just can’t go wrong with Mistuh Pierre Beauregard Dupree behind the wheel, known to his close friends as Beau. Up from the Louisiana bayou, this Good Old Boy is all smiles until he gets behind the wheel of his supercharged ‘71 Hemi ‘Cuda, Traveller.  en you better look out and try to hold on, because there’s nothing faster on these streets!

<h3>Attributes:</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve chosen to be a Good Old Boy, it’s time to select your Attributes. Attributes describe the core of your character in Spirit of 77: Is your Good Old Boy sharper than a mule kick? Or maybe he’s sweet-tongued and devilish? Your choice of Attributes will determine this, hotshot.
<p>Choose one of the following arrays of Attributes and distribute them between Might, Hustle, Smooth, Brains and Soul however you want. Keep in mind the moves you’ve already selected and their associated Attributes and don’t forget, although you can raise an Attribute from 0 to +1 later, you cannot raise an Attribute from -1 to 0 through XP.
<p>Good on All Terrains: Take one point for every Attribute and put it in Park.  is gets your Attributes together quickly and promotes an overall balanced skillset.
<div>1, 1, 1, 1, 1</div>
<p>Just a Bit Better: Pick one Attribute as your specialty, and add +2. Choose two secondary Attributes and add +1.  is is good when you know you’ll be focusing on a specific skill in game (like driving), but still want to maintain other useful skills (like surviving).
<div>2, 1, 1, 0, 0</div>
<p>Watch Your Blind Spot: Pick one Attribute as your specialty and add +2. Choose one Attribute you’re not so good at and give it -1. Give the other Attributes +1 and keep an eye on the rearview.
<div>2, 1, 1, 1, -1</div>
<p>Built for Speed: Pick the two Attributes you’re planning to use the most and add +2. Choose one Attribute you’re not so good at and give it -1. Forget the others, you won’t use ‘em. Leave them at zero.
<div>2, 2, 0, 0, -1</div>
<p>These Hands Were Meant To Drive: Anything else just doesn’t matter. Pick the two Attributes you’re planning to use the most and add +2. Choose two Attri- butes you’re not so good at and give them -1. Whatever’s left, give +1. Now let’s burn some rubber!
