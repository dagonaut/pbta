<h1> Introducing the Rocker</h1>
<br />Tell me, Rocker. When you bought that  rst six-string from the second-hand store, did it feel good in your hands? It’s a one-way ticket, if you don’t stop rock- ing and keep on the road. Who knows, if you become a rock star I might play one of your hit songs. But in the meantime, keep those stars in your eyes, your feet on the ground and reach for the heavens. Here’s Ethan with tra c...
<br />Rockers are the working musicians of 1977, utilizing their musical talents to pursue their big stage dreams. Rockers may have day jobs they’re using to get by, but they live and die for the gig next Saturday night.
<br />Example:
<br />He’s got a broken nose and a broken heart, but when Johnny Valentine takes the microphone, everyone stops to listen. A modern-day crooner with sad-dog eyes that can never catch a break, but he can always make the ladies cry with a soulful song. When Johnny’s part of your crew, you know he’s bringing the groove.

<h3> Rocker Moves:</h3>
You Get:<br />
<br /><strong>Mesmerizing: You don’t just perform, you share your deep personal feelings with those around you, Rockers start with +1 Soul (Max +3)<br />
...and Choose 2:<br />
<br /><strong>Backstage Pass: In the night-time world, they always believe you’re either with the band or “on the list”. You can always get into or backstage at a venue such as a concert, theater or nightclub. Getting other people in with you will require a successful Getting What You Want move.
<br /><strong>God of  under: If it’s too loud, then they’re too old and it’s time to use it to your advantage! When you play on your instrument, turn up the volume and roll +Soul:<br />
On a 10+, multiple targets within the scene get deafened, staggering around at a disadvantage.<br />
On a 7-9, only one target gets deafened.<br />
<br /><strong>Black Belt in Crazy: When you sit out a  ght to play an inspiring tune to  re up your friends, while performing, everyone on the team rolls with Something Extra and gains the area trait for their melee attacks.
<br /><strong>This Song’s For You: When you dedicate a song and sing it to someone, you can use +Smooth instead of +Brains when Giving them the  ird Degree and you can also roll with Something Extra on your next +Smooth roll involving them.
<br /><strong>Groupie Magnet:</strong> Rockers tend to gather groups of dedicated fans around them who will do nearly anything to please the Rocker.
Groupies count as a gang of “a couple of guys” (1-5 members).  ough they are nearly worthless in combat (1-harm, 0-armor), they can always be used for other tasks. When you suggest that a groupie do a favor for you, roll +Smooth.<br />
On a 10+, they do exactly what you want. On a 7-9, they ask you for a favor in return.<br />


<h3> Attributes:</h3>
<p>Now that you’re going for the bright lights as a Rocker, it’s time to select your Attributes. Attributes describe the core of your character in Spirit of 77. Is your Rocker a pretty face for the teen magazines? Or maybe a musical genius with a head for the business numbers? Your choice of Attributes will determine this, rockstar.
<p>Chose one of the following arrays of Attributes and distribute them between Might, Hustle, Smooth, Brains and Soul however you want. Keep in mind the moves you’ve already selected and their associated Attributes and don’t forget, although you can raise an Attribute from 0 to +1 later, you cannot raise an Attribute from -1 to 0 through XP.
<p>Session Player: Take one point for every Attribute. Easy like Sunday morning.  is is good for getting your Attributes together quickly and promotes an overall balance between treble, mid and bass.
<div>1, 1, 1, 1, 1</div>
<p>Goes to Eleven: Pick one Attribute as your specialty, and add +2. Choose two secondary Attributes and add +1.  is is good when you know you’ll be focusing on your muse but still want to maintain some skills o stage.
<div>2, 1, 1, 0, 0</div>
<p>Great In Your Genre: Pick one Attribute as your specialty and add +2. Choose one Attribute you’re not so good at and give it -1. (Who needs a ballad). Now give the other Attributes +1 and head to band practice.
<div>2, 1, 1, 1, -1</div>
<p>Hot Blooded: Pick the two Attributes you’re planning to use the most and add +2. Choose one Attribute you’re not so good at and give it -1. Leave everything else at zero, you crazy diamond.
<div>2, 2, 0, 0, -1</div>
<p>Solo Artist: Pick the two Attributes you’re planning to use the most and add +2. Choose two Attributes you’re not so good at and give them -1. Round it o  by giving whatever’s left +1. Rock and roll! WOO!
<div>2, 2, 1, -1, -1</div>
<h3>Check it! - Remember as a Rocker you get an additional +1 to Soul.</h3>
