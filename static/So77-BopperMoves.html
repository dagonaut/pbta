<h1>Bopper Moves:</h1>
You Get:<br />
<strong>Gang:</strong> The Bopper is either a leader or high-ranking member of one of the City’s street gangs, members of your gang are available to accompany you on adventures or as back-up in an emergency. By default, your gang consists of about 15 violent bastards with simple weapons and bad attitudes (Small gang: 2-harm, 0-armor, unruly).<br />
First, choose two benefits:<br />
• Your gang consists of 30 or so violent bastards. [Benefit: Medium instead of Small.]<br />
• Your gang’s well-armed. [Benefit: +1-harm.]<br />
• Your gang’s well-armored. [Benefit: +1-armor.]<br />
• One of your gang members carries an exotic weapon, such as explosives, molotov cocktails or a machine gun. [Benefit: the weapon in question.]<br />
• You have the respect of the entire gang [Benefit: Remove ‘unruly’ as a trait]<br />
• Your gang’s nomadic at heart; they have bikes, cars or other transportation. [Benefit: It gets +mobile, and your home turf is considered the area they roam.]<br />
Then, choose one:<br />
• Your gang’s loose-knit, with members coming and going as they choose. [Vulnerable: Desertion]<br />
• Your gang is in signi cant debt to someone powerful. [Vulnerable: Obliga- tion]<br />
• Your gang has a bad reputation among other gangs. [Vulnerable: Notorious]<br />
• Your gang is especially bloodthirsty and has little regard for the life of others. [Vulnerable: Savage]<br />
• Your territory is far away, your gang has no access to transportation or are otherwise isolated. [Vulnerable: Grounded]<br />
Warchief: Your gang will follow you under normal circumstances, but there may be times you need to command your gang to stick their necks out, based on your words alone. When you try to impose your will on your gang, roll +Might.<br />
On a 10+, all three: On a 7–9, choose one:<br />
• They do what you want.<br />
• They don’t fight back over it.<br />
• You don’t have to make an example of one of them.<br />
On a 6 or less, someone in your gang may make a dedicated bid to replace you for Alpha.<br />

 ...and choose one:<br />
<br /><strong>Home Field Advantage:</strong> When you prepare to to defend yourself in a rumble that takes place on your home turf, roll +Smooth:<br />
On a 10+, pick two of the following results: On a 7-9, pick one:<br />
• Your gang brings reinforcements, increase the size of your gang by one level (Small becomes Medium, Medium becomes Large).<br />
• Your gang digs into its weapon cache, adding +1 harm to attacks.<br />
• Your gang fortifies it’s position, providing +1 armor.<br />
<br /><strong>Colors:</strong> When you encounter another Bopper, in uential street  gure or other gang member, roll +Smooth.<br />
On a 10+ they recognize your colors, and you say what they’ve heard about you. (roll with Something Extra when dealing with them for the rest of the Scene).<br />
On a 7-9, they recognize you, the DJ will say something truthful that they know about you.
<br /><strong>Marked Territory:</strong> When you enter into a new part of the city, you have the op- tion of marking the territory with your gang’s emblem. When you return to that part of the city, roll with Something Extra on all rolls while in this part of the city.  is lasts for as long as your gra ti remains visible, DJ’s discretion.
<br /><strong>Semper Fi:</strong> Your gang is more loyal than most. When in your presence your gang will always  ght to the last man. When your gang takes action in your absence, they remain intact at 4-harm instead of 3-harm.
<br /><strong>One for the Team:</strong> When you or your gang would take damage, you can transfer 1-harm dealt to you to the gang itself or transfer one harm dealt to your gang to you.
<br /><strong>Plan On a Napkin:</strong> When you make a plan of attack and explain it to the rest of your team, roll +Brains.<br />
On a 10+, hold 3. On 7-9, hold 1.<br />
While executing the plan, you can spend 1 hold to allow a member of your team roll with Something Extra on any move.<br />


<h3>Attributes:</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve chosen to be a Bopper, it’s time to select your Attributes. At- tributes describe the core of your character in Spirit of 77 - is your Bopper the strong, silent type that makes the neighborhood girls sigh? Or maybe the friendly joker that everyone knows and likes? Your choice of Attributes will determine this, so pick smart!</p>
<p>Choose one of the following arrays of Attributes and distribute them between Might, Hustle, Smooth, Brains and Soul however you want. Keep in mind the moves you’ve already selected and their associated Attributes and don’t forget, although you can raise an attribute from 0 to +1 later, you cannot raise an Attribute from -1 to 0 through XP.</p>
<p>Ready for Anything: Take one point for every Attribute. Boom, you’re done.  is is good for getting your Attributes together quickly and promotes an overall bal-
anced set of skills.</p>
<div>1, 1, 1, 1, 1</div>
<p>Taking Point: Pick one Attribute as your specialty, and add +2. Choose two secondary Attributes and add +1.  is is good when you know you’ll be focusing on a speci c skill like  ghting or thinking things out, but still want to maintain a well-rounded character. ( Just in case).</p>
<div>2,1,1,0,0</div>
<p>Heavy Muscle: Pick one Attribute as your specialty and add +2. Choose 1 Attri- bute you’re not so good at it and give it -1. Give the other Attributes +1 and keep your weak spot covered by your guys.</p>
<div>2,1,1,1,-1</div>
<p>Better  an  e Rest: Pick the two Attributes you’re planning to use the most and add +2. Choose one Attribute you’re not so good at and give it -1. Forget the others, they’re not important. Leave them at zero.</p>
<div>2,2,0,0,-1</div>
<p>The One and Only: You have a special purpose in your gang that sets you apart. Pick the two Attributes you’re planning to use the most and add +2. Choose 2 Attributes you’re not so good at it and give them -1. What’s left? Eh, give it +1.</p>
