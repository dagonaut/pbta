<h1>Introducing the Honeypot</h1>
<br />Oh, you’re cool, baby. Yes you are. You got moves they ain’t ever seen. If you think you can work what you got, make them do what you want with just a lick and a smile. You’re a big ol’ pot of sweetness, sugar. Doesn’t matter if you’re a gigolo or just a sweet sexy thing. Why get your hands dirty when you look so clean?
<br />Whether you’re a rich heiress using your trust fund and good lucks to cause shenanigans or a social-climbing hairdresser trying to start his own salon, Honeypots are all about using seduction and charisma to get what they want.
<br />Example:
<br />Smooth and dangerous, that’s how you describe the glamorous Corrina Vanderbilt, con artist and cat burglar extraordinaire. Using her wiles to learn the secrets of her targets before a midnight heist, Corrina is the best at her trade, leaving no evidence behind other than a hint of Chanel No. 5 lingering in the air.

<h1>Honeypot Moves:</h1>
You Get:<br />
<strong>Queen/King of the Scene:</strong> Either because of their personality, beautiful looks or maybe it’s just a touch of the Glam, Honeypots get +1 to Smooth (Max +3).<br />
...And Choose 2:<br />
<strong>Sometimes Less is More:</strong>  The less you wear the harder you are to hit. When you are naked or nearly naked, gain 2-armor. When you are topless or wearing revealing, non-armor clothing, gain 1-armor. If you are wearing any armor, use it instead.<br />
<strong>Angel Eyes:</strong> When you gaze longingly into the eyes of someone who means you harm, roll +Smooth.<br />
On 10+, they drop their weapon and take a step back. On a 7-9, they redirect their hostility elsewhere.<br />
<strong>Another Satisfied Customer:</strong> You’ve got a salesman’s smile, and can convince anyone that they’re getting the best part of a deal. When you successfully strike a deal with a character to Get What You Want, you may always choose the option “ ey are happy with the bargain”, in addition to the options chosen as a result of the move.<br />
<strong>One Won’t Kill You:<strong> Sometimes a little social lubrication is needed. When you successfully convince someone to share in a vice (cigarettes, alcohol, etc.), roll with Something Extra when dealing with them, and gain +1 hold when Giving them the third Degree.<br />
<strong>Tell Me I’m Pretty:</strong> When someone uses  attery to encourage you to do your best, they may roll +your Soul when Helping A Brother Out.

<h3>Attributes:</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve chosen to be a Honeypot, it’s time to select your Attributes. At- tributes describe the core of your character in Spirit of 77. Is your Honeypot built and statuesque? Maybe they’re too cool for school, and quick with the comeback. Your choice of Attributes will determine that lingering memory you leave behind.
<p>Choose one of the following arrays of Attributes and distribute them between Might, Hustle, Smooth, Brains and Soul however you want. Keep in mind the moves you’ve already selected and their associated Attributes and don’t forget, although you can raise an Attribute from 0 to +1 later, you cannot raise an Attribute from -1 to 0 through XP.
<p>Streets or the Sheets: Take one point for every Attribute and disco, you’re all done!  is is good for getting your Attributes together quickly and promotes an overall balanced set of skills. Let’s start shaking it!

Say What? - Honeypots and Sex
“So what, these characters are nothing but sluts?”
No. Well they can be, sure. But more importantly they’re social manipulators who use their good looks, charisma and sexuality in order to further their pursuit of their Buzz.
“So they’re users.”
To an extent. But they may not necessarily be bad people.
“Are they only women?”
Heck no.
“Name an example that’s a guy.”
Warren Beatty.
“In which movie?”
All of them.</p>
