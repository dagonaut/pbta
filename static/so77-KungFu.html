<p>Urban samurai, wandering monk or even Special Forces killer, you’ve spent most of your life training and developing your body into a weapon. You know a variety of kung fu techniques that make you a danger to anyone standing in your way.</p>
You Get:

On a 10+ they are paralyzed until the end of the Scene unless you release them.<br />
On a 7-9, a part of their body (your choice) is paralyzed until the end of the Scene unless you release them.

<br /><strong>Floating Cherry Blossom: You have mastered superhuman acrobatic techniques that allow you to jump and fall great distances as well as slowly traverse incredibly fragile and precarious surfaces.

• Serpent Strike Technique - Your unarmed attacks gain the armor piercing trait.<br />
• Crane Form Technique - Your unarmed attacks gain the area trait.<br />
• Tiger Form Technique - Your unarmed attacks gain the forceful trait.<br />
Note: When leveling up you may take this move more than once, selecting a different option each time.

On a 10+ you can act normally.<br />
On a 7-9 you can act but you may have missed something important around you.
