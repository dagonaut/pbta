<h3>Attributes:</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve chosen to be a Tough Guy, it’s time to select your Attributes. Attributes describe the core of your character in Spirit of 77. Is your Tough Guy strong? Of course he is. Is he smart? Maybe, maybe not. Your choice of Attributes will determine this, slugger.
Choose one of the following arrays of attributes and distribute them between Might, Hustle, Smooth, Brains and Soul however you want. Keep in mind the moves you’ve already selected and their associated Attributes and don’t forget, although you can raise an Attribute from 0 to +1 later, you cannot raise an Attribute from -1 to 0 through XP.
Solid, Jackson: Take one point for every Attribute. Done and done.  is is good for getting your Attributes together quickly and into the ring.</p>

<p>Right One for  e Job: Pick one Attribute as your specialty, and add +2. Choose two secondary Attributes and add +1.  is is good when you know you’ll be focusing on a specific skill in-game like fighting, but still want to maintain a well- rounded character... for some reason.</p>
<div>2, 1, 1, 0, 0</div>
<p>Achilles Heel: Pick one Attribute as your specialty and add +2. Choose one Attribute you’re not so good at and give it -1. Give the other Attributes +1. Hey, even Kareem Abdul-Jabbar couldn’t stand bright light in Game of Death.</p>

<p>I’m Here for Two  ings: Pick the two Attributes you’re planning to use the most and add +2. Choose one Attribute you’re not so good at and give it -1. For- get the others, you don’t plan to back up. Leave them at zero. Now take ‘em out!</p>
