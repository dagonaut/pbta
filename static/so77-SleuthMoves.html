<h1> Introducing the Sleuth</h1>
<br />Oh, you’ve got it all  gured out don’t you, baby?  e world is full of secrets and you intend to  nd them all. Bring the truth out into the light of day for everyone to see. Well let me tell you something, some secrets don’t want to be found.
<br />Sleuths pay homage to all the great TV detective shows where dogged detective work and asking a lot of questions keep you moving forward (although sometimes into the face of danger). Sleuths come in all shapes and sizes, from bald-headed players with Armani suits and a lollipop to rumpled mumblers in raincoats with a walleye. But they all share the same pursuit of answers to the mysteries of the City.
<br />Example:
<br />When there’s an impossible mystery, teen computer genius Riley Russell is here to save the day as the crime-solving expert in red tennis shoes. With his 250 IQ and his Aunt Agatha in her lime-green station wagon, nothing gets past Riley’s keen skills of observation and encyclopedic memory (provided he can get out early of his afternoon gym class).

<h3>Attributes:</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve chosen to be a Sleuth, it’s time to select your Attributes. At- tributes describe the core of your character in Spirit of 77. Is your Sleuth rough and tumble, a blunt instrument to get to the truth? Or maybe devious and crafty, tricking people into revealing their secrets? Your choice of Attributes will deter- mine this, but what’s best is the mystery...
Choose one of the following arrays of Attributes and distribute them between Might, Hustle, Smooth, Brains and Soul however you want. Keep in mind the moves you’ve already selected and their associated Attributes and don’t forget, although you can raise an Attribute from 0 to +1 later, you cannot raise an Attribute from -1 to 0 through XP.
