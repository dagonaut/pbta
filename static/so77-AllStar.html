<h1>It’s All About Being An All-Star</h1>
<p>Look at you, you had your face on a cereal box and everything until you had that knee injury. Or was it the time the Man pulled over your Trans Am while you were hold- ing? Fast rise, fast fall, Momma used to say. Now you’re picking up the pieces, trying to keep sharp while waiting for a spot in the roster to open.
All-Stars are former professional (or semi-professional) athletes, be they football quarterbacks, Derbyball runners, Olympic decathletes or even scratch bowlers. All-Stars may be past their prime but the skills they learned on the court can be invaluable out on the street.</p>
You Get:<br />
<strong>Playing Hurt:</strong> Once the adrenalin kicks in, you shift into overdrive. When you’ve experienced 2 or more +harm, roll with Something Extra for all Might and Hustle rolls for the remainder of the Scene.<br />
...and Choose 1:
<br /><strong>Walk it Off, Son:</strong> When you berate someone about su ering a minor injury (2-harm or less), roll +Smooth.<br />
On a 10+ they ignore the damage completely (heal up to 2-harm). On a 7-9 they ignore the injury until the end of the Scene.<br />
On a 6 or less, it really is a big deal and they take 1 additional harm.<br />
<br /><strong>Ignore The Crowd:</strong> Working under pressure is your specialty. When everything is on the line and only you can overcome the obstacle, roll with Something Extra.
<br /><strong>Rope-a-Dope:</strong> When you make your opponent believe you are more vulnerable than you really are, Roll +Brains.
On a 10+ roll with Something Extra against the target for the rest of the Scene.<br />
On 7-9 you roll with Something Extra on the next attack against the target.<br />
<br /><strong>Cheap Shot Artist:</strong> You’re skilled at sneaking in a dirty hit on the big plays. When successfully Taking a Hit or Getting Out of the Way from a melee attack, deal 1-harm to your opponent.
<br /><strong>Hail Mary:</strong> When you use a thrown weapon, you may extend the range one dis- tance category (close becomes far, far becomes extreme).
<br /><strong>Gonna Fly Now (requires Playing Hurt):</strong> Increase one Attribute from +1 to +2. Eye of the Tiger (requires Playing Hurt): Increase one Attribute from +2 to +3.
