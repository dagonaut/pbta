<h1>It’s All About Being A War Vet</h1>
<p>Welcome back, soldier, now that you’ve rotated back to the world. Whether it was two years or 24 hours ago, you can still close your eyes and imagine yourself back in the shit. Nightmares still bugging you, baby? I’m so sorry to hear that, best I can do is play you a song...</p>
<p>Whether it was Vietnam, Korea, Normandy or some battle field no one’s heard of, you’ve been in the thick of it, watching bullets fly and good men die. War Vets have learned a lot of skills and made a lot of friends in the service. But now they’re stateside and trying to rebuild their lives.</p>
You Get:
<br /><strong>I Got a Buddy...:</strong> You’ve served with people all over the country, when you call upon an old military buddy to do you a small favor describe how you met and roll +Smooth.
<br />On a 10+, your friend can get you specialized access to information, minor supplies a place to stay or other items determined by the DJ. On a 7-9, it’s going to cost you or you’re not going to get exactly what you want.
<br />...and Choose 1:
<br /><strong>Crazy Brave:</strong> When you lead the charge into combat, those you lead can add your +Soul bonus to their next action.
<br /><strong>Regular at The VA:</strong> War Vets have access to veterans administration medical services. When you go to the VA hospital for medical attention roll +Brains.
<br />On a 10+ take all 3: On a 7-9 pick 2: On a 6- pick 1:
<br />• You get in without waiting
<br />• You don’t have to pay for care • No questions were asked
<br /><strong>Motor Pool:</strong> Thanks to your time in the Army and jury-rigging jeeps in hot situations, when you try to repair a vehicle without the proper tools, roll +Brains.
<br />On a 10+, you manage as if you had a fully stocked toolbox.
<br />On a 7-9, you’re missing something critical - the repairs are temporary and could give out at any time.
<br /><strong>Brothers in Green:</strong> When you meet someone else who served in the military, roll +Soul.
<br />On a 10+, you’ve got friends in common - roll with Something Extra on social interactions with this character permanently.
<br />On a 7-9, you reminisce about your time in the service. Roll with Something Extra for the rest of the Scene.
<br /><strong>Army Medic:</strong> When successfully using first aid on a seriously wounded character, heal 1-harm as well as stabilizing them.
<br /><strong>No Man Left Behind:</strong> When helping a wounded comrade, you can choose to roll+harm (the number of harm they have taken) instead of +Hooks to Help A Brother Out.
<br /><strong>Second Tour (Requires I Got a Buddy...):</strong> Increase one Attribute from +1 to +2.
<br /><strong>Earned Your Stripes (Requires I Got a Buddy...):</strong> Increase one Attribute from +2 to +3.
