<h1>It’s All About The X-Tech</h1>
<p>Only people with no imagination stop at the final frontier, my babies. Nah, It’s the smart kids who earn the coolest toys. Computers that can fit on your desk? Orbiting space satellites? And Eight-track cassettes in every car? What on Earth and beyond are you space cadets going to think of next?</p>
<br />Robots and bionic men, phone phreaks and computer geeks. The future is right in front of us and X-Tech is the way to get there.
