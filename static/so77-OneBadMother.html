<h1>It’s All About Being One Bad Mother</h1>
<p>You’re so cool. You’re a complicated soul, only understood by your lover. Whether you come from the mean streets of Chicago, Spanish Harlem or Philly, it’s all the same - you started hard from the wrong side of the tracks and do what it takes to survive. You’re bad...and reeeeal good at it.</p>
<p>Bikers, brawlers and bad asses. Doesn’t matter your nationality or gender, being One Bad Mother is as much about having a reputation for kicking ass as it is knowing how to back it up. Either from fear or respect, when you walk down the street, people get out of your way. Whatever you do, you do it with style and finesse. You treat your enemies with relentless brutality and your lovers with red hot passion. You’re not just from the streets, you are the streets.</p>
